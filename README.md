```

Test the project. You should be able to turn on and off the effects using the Menu (press Esc to activate).

Quit Godot. In GitHub desktop, add a summary message, commit your changes and push them back to GitHub. If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see your updated files with the time when they were changed.

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-03b-Tweening-and-Screen-Shake) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing my information with yours):
